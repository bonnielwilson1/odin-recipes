<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Low-fat, low-calorie, easy, and delish! Swai is also known as basa and is less expensive. It has a very mild flavor
    and is as close to chicken as fish can get - not fishy at all!</p>
<h3>Ingredients (serves 1, 158 calories)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 (4 ounce) fillet swai fish</li>
    <li>1 pinch Greek seasoning, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot skillet
        until lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 minute. Move garlic to one side of skillet.
    </li>
    <li>Place swai fish into the skillet and season with Greek seasoning. Spoon garlic onto top of fish. Cook until
        edges of fish are white and bottom is browned, about 5 minutes. Flip fish and cook until fish flakes easily with
        a fork, about 5 minutes more.</li>
